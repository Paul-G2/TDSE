# TDSE

This project implements solvers for the time-dependent Schrodinger equation. 

Currently there are solvers for 
* One particle in two dimensions, 
* One particle in three dimensions
* Two particles in two dimensions (with a separable interaction potential)
* Two particles in two dimensions (with a non-separable interaction potential)
* Two particles in three dimensions (with a separable interaction potential)

A UI is provided for entering variables such as the average position and momentum of the initial wavepacket, the 
potential energy function, the grid size, etc. The output is a set of vtk files that can be rendered in ParaView.

See the "Sample Outputs" folder or [this YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoCLRhXLs5MFSN7FMb-VlCA) for some results.
