# TDSE

This project implements solvers for the time-dependent Schrodinger equation. 

Currently there are two solvers, for 1-particle in two dimensions, and 1-particle in three dimensions. 
(I plan to add multi-particle solvers in the future.)

A UI is provided for entering quantities such as the average position and momentum of the initial wavepacket, the 
potential energy function, the grid size, etc. The output is a set of vtk files that can be rendered in ParaView.

See the "Sample Outputs" folder for some results.
