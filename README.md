# TDSE

This project implements solvers for the time-dependent Schrodinger equation. 

Currently there is only a single solver, for the case of 1-particle in two dimensions. (I plan to add more solvers in the future.)

A UI is provided for entering quantities such as the average position and momentum of the initial wavepacket, the 
potential energy function, the grid size, etc. The output is a set of vtk files that can be rendered in Paraview.
