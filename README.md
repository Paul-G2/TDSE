This project implements solvers for the time-dependent Schrodinger equation. 

Currently there are three solvers, for 1-particle in two dimensions, 1-particle in three dimensions,
ans 2 particles in two dimensions. (I plan to add more solvers in the future.)

A UI is provided for entering quantities such as the average position and momentum of the initial wavepacket, the 
potential energy function, the grid size, etc. The output is a set of vtk files that can be rendered in ParaView.

See the "Sample Outputs" folder for some results.
