# TDSE

This project implements solvers for the time-dependent Schrodinger equation. 

Currently there are four solvers, for 
* One particle in two dimensions, 
* One particle in three dimensions
* Two particles in two dimensions 
* Two particles in three dimensions

A UI is provided for entering quantities such as the average position and momentum of the initial wavepacket, the 
potential energy function, the grid size, etc. The output is a set of vtk files that can be rendered in ParaView.

See the "Sample Outputs" folder for some results.
